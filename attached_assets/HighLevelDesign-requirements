üìÑ Requirements Document: Disk Monitoring & JIRA Ticketing System

Project Name:

Disk Monitoring and Automated JIRA Ticketing System

Objective:

To build a fully open-source, local monitoring solution on macOS that tracks disk health and storage usage. Upon crossing specified thresholds (e.g., low disk space or SMART health failure), the system must automatically raise a JIRA ticket assigned to the Ops team.

1. Functional Requirements

ID	Requirement Description
FR1	The system must monitor disk space usage on all mounted filesystems.
FR2	The system must monitor SMART disk health metrics using smartmontools.
FR3	The system must trigger alerts when disk usage exceeds a configurable threshold (e.g., 90%).
FR4	The system must trigger alerts if SMART status indicates failure or pre-failure.
FR5	Alerts must be forwarded to a locally running webhook endpoint.
FR6	The webhook must parse alert data and format it into a valid JIRA issue.
FR7	A new JIRA issue must be created automatically when a critical alert is received.
FR8	The JIRA ticket must be created in a specified project (e.g., ‚ÄúDCOPS‚Äù).
FR9	The JIRA ticket must be automatically assigned to a default assignee (e.g., ‚Äúdatacenter.ops‚Äù).
FR10	All tools used must be open-source or free-tier solutions.
FR11	The system must work locally on macOS without requiring external agents.

2. Non-Functional Requirements

ID	Requirement Description
NFR1	The system must use only open-source or free-tier tools and APIs.
NFR2	The solution must be portable to Linux and cloud-native environments later.
NFR3	Alert thresholds must be configurable and tunable.
NFR4	JIRA API tokens and sensitive data must be stored securely (e.g., via environment variables).
NFR5	Alerts must include a delay window (for: X mins) to avoid flapping.
NFR6	The system must log webhook requests and ticket creation events for debugging.
NFR7	The webhook server must return HTTP 200 on successful ticket creation and log errors.
NFR8	System must support easy local testing and validation workflows.

3. Features to Be Implemented

ID	Feature Description
F1	Prometheus configuration for local metric scraping (Node Exporter)
F2	Node Exporter setup for exposing disk space and file system metrics
F3	smartmontools installation and periodic health check integration
F4	Alertmanager setup to forward disk alerts to a custom webhook
F5	Flask-based Python server to receive and parse Alertmanager alerts
F6	JIRA integration via REST API to create issues automatically
F7	.env configuration file for storing sensitive credentials
F8	Support for dynamic JIRA fields: summary, description, assignee, project
F9	Simple logs printed to console for success/failure feedback
F10	Example Prometheus alert rules and SMART command integration for extensibility


‚∏ª

4. Constraints
	‚Ä¢	Must run entirely on a single MacBook.
	‚Ä¢	JIRA instance must be Atlassian Cloud with API access enabled.
	‚Ä¢	No paid tools or SaaS services may be used in the pipeline.
	‚Ä¢	The system must not rely on external monitoring infrastructure or VPNs.
