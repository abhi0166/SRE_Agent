# Slack Events API Setup for Interactive Alert Assignment

This guide explains how to configure Slack Events API to enable 2-way communication for alert assignment through emoji reactions.

## Overview

The interactive alert assignment feature allows users to:
- React to storage alert messages with "taking a look" emojis (üëÄ, üîç, üî®, üõ†Ô∏è, ‚öôÔ∏è)
- Automatically assign themselves to alerts
- Update alert status in the database
- Show assignment information in the original Slack message

## Slack App Configuration

### 1. Enable Events API in Your Slack App

1. Go to [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Select your existing monitoring app
3. Navigate to **Event Subscriptions** in the left sidebar
4. Toggle **Enable Events** to On

### 2. Configure Request URL

Set the Request URL to your webhook server's events endpoint:
```
https://your-domain.replit.app/slack/events
```

**Important:** The URL must be publicly accessible and return a valid challenge response.

### 3. Subscribe to Bot Events

Add the following bot events:
- `reaction_added` - When users add emoji reactions to messages
- `reaction_removed` - When users remove emoji reactions (optional)

### 4. Reinstall App to Workspace

After adding events, you'll need to reinstall the app to your workspace to grant the new permissions.

## Supported Reaction Emojis

The system recognizes these emojis as "taking a look" assignments:
- üëÄ `:eyes:` - Taking a look
- üîç `:mag:` - Investigating  
- üî® `:hammer_and_wrench:` - Working on it
- üõ†Ô∏è `:tools:` - Using tools to fix
- ‚öôÔ∏è `:gear:` - Engineering response

## How It Works

### 1. Alert Flow
1. Storage monitor detects issue
2. Alert sent to Slack with rich formatting
3. Slack message timestamp stored in database
4. JIRA ticket created automatically

### 2. Assignment Flow
1. User reacts to alert message with supported emoji
2. Slack sends reaction event to `/slack/events` endpoint
3. System identifies user and alert from message timestamp
4. Database updated with assignment information
5. Original Slack message updated to show assignment

### 3. Database Updates
When a user reacts with an assignment emoji:
```json
{
  "assigned_to_slack_user": "U1234567890",
  "assigned_to_username": "John Smith",
  "assigned_at": "2025-06-17T20:30:00Z",
  "assignment_method": "slack_reaction",
  "status": "assigned"
}
```

## Required Permissions

Your Slack app needs these OAuth scopes:
- `chat:write` - Send messages
- `reactions:read` - Read message reactions
- `users:read` - Get user information
- `channels:history` - Read channel messages (for updating)

## Testing the Setup

### 1. URL Verification
First test will be Slack's URL verification challenge:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.replit.app/slack/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"url_verification","challenge":"test_challenge"}'
```

Expected response: `test_challenge`

### 2. Reaction Event Test
Send a test alert and react with üëÄ emoji. Check logs for:
```
INFO:slack_events:Successfully assigned John Smith to alert alert_12345
```

### 3. Database Verification
Check alert assignment in database:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/alerts/alert_12345
```

## Troubleshooting

### Events Not Received
- Verify Request URL is publicly accessible
- Check Slack app has correct permissions
- Ensure app is reinstalled after adding events

### Assignment Not Working
- Check user permissions in channel
- Verify message timestamp matching in database
- Review server logs for error details

### Message Update Fails
- Ensure bot has `chat:write` permission
- Check if original message still exists
- Verify channel access permissions

## Security Considerations

1. **Request Verification**: Implement Slack request signature validation
2. **Rate Limiting**: Monitor reaction event frequency
3. **User Validation**: Verify users are authorized for alert assignment
4. **Channel Restrictions**: Limit events to designated monitoring channels

## Advanced Features

### Custom Assignment Rules
Modify `slack_events.py` to implement:
- Role-based assignment restrictions
- Escalation timeouts
- Multiple assignee support
- Assignment notifications

### Integration with JIRA
Extend functionality to:
- Update JIRA ticket assignee
- Add comments to tickets
- Sync assignment status

### Metrics and Analytics
Track assignment patterns:
- Response times by user
- Alert resolution rates
- Team engagement metrics

## Configuration Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:
```bash
# Existing Slack configuration
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=C1234567890

# Optional: Slack signing secret for request verification
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-signing-secret
```

## API Endpoints

- `POST /slack/events` - Handle Slack Events API callbacks
- `GET /api/alerts/{alert_id}` - View alert assignment status
- `PUT /api/alerts/{alert_id}/assign` - Manually assign alerts

The interactive assignment system is now ready to enhance your storage monitoring workflow with seamless Slack integration.
